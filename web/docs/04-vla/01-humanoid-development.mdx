# Humanoid Robot Development

Building a humanoid robot is one of the grand challenges of robotics. Unlike wheeled robots, bipeds are inherently unstable. They must constantly fight gravity to stay upright.

## Bipedal Locomotion

Walking is essentially "controlled falling".

- **Zero Moment Point (ZMP)**: The point on the ground where the total tipping moment is zero. To stay balanced, the ZMP must be inside the support polygon (the feet).
- **Inverse Kinematics (IK)**: Calculating joint angles to place the foot at a specific position.

## Balance Control Loop

A simple balance controller typically uses a PID loop to keep the torso upright based on IMU data.

```python title="balance_controller.py"
class BalanceController:
    def __init__(self, target_pitch=0.0):
        self.target_pitch = target_pitch
        self.kp = 10.0  # Proportional gain
        self.kd = 0.5   # Derivative gain
        self.prev_error = 0.0

    def compute_torque(self, current_pitch, current_velocity):
        error = self.target_pitch - current_pitch
        d_error = -current_velocity # changing error rate
        
        # PID Output (Torque)
        torque = (self.kp * error) + (self.kd * d_error)
        return torque

# Simulation Loop
controller = BalanceController()
current_pitch = get_imu_pitch() # from sensor
cmd_torque = controller.compute_torque(current_pitch, 0.1)
send_motor_command(cmd_torque)
```

:::warning Safety First
Humanoid robots are heavy and can fall unexpectedly. Always use a gantry or safety harness when testing balance algorithms on real hardware.
