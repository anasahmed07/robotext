# Module 4: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) Models

## Introduction

Welcome to Module 4, the cutting edge of Physical AI! Learn about Vision-Language-Action models that enable robots to understand, reason, and act.

## What You'll Learn

In this module, you will:
- Understand multimodal AI systems (vision + language + action)
- Learn how robots perceive and interpret visual information
- Explore language-based robot control
- Combine perception, reasoning, and physical actions

## Prerequisites

- Completion of Modules 1, 2, and 3
- Strong Python programming skills
- Understanding of neural networks and computer vision basics

## Getting Started

VLA models represent the future of robotics - systems that can see, understand language, and perform physical tasks. Let's explore this exciting frontier!
