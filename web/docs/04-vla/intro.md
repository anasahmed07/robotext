# Module 4: Humanoid Robotics & VLA

## Introduction

Welcome to **Module 4**, the final leg of our journey. Here, we bring everything together: ROS 2, Simulation, and AI, to power the most complex machines ever built—**Humanoid Robots**.

We will also explore **Vision-Language-Action (VLA)** models, the technology that allows us to speak to robots as we do to humans.

## Module Curriculum

1.  **Humanoid Hardware**: Scaling up to 23+ degrees of freedom.
2.  **Whole-Body Control**: Balancing on two feet.
3.  **Conversational AI**: Integrating LLMs (GPT-4) with robotic actions.

### Topics Covered

- **[Humanoid Robot Development](./01-humanoid-development.mdx)**
    - **Unitree G1**: Working with real humanoid platforms.
    - **Whole-Body Control**: The math behind walking and balancing.
    - **Safety**: Preventing expensive crashes.

- **[Conversational Robotics (Capstone)](./02-conversational-robotics.mdx)**
    - **VLA Architecture**: Connecting Whisper, CLIP, and LLMs.
    - **Capstone Project**: Building an end-to-end "Intelligent Fetch" robot.

## Prerequisites

- **Modules 1-3**: This is the deep end of the pool.
- **Python**: You will be writing complex node interactions.

## Getting Started

It is time to build the future.
