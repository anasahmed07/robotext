## Physical AI Education Platform

Welcome to **Robotext** - your comprehensive learning platform for Physical AI, robotics, and embodied intelligence. Whether you're a beginner taking your first steps into robotics or an experienced developer looking to master advanced concepts, Robotext provides structured, hands-on learning paths.

## What is Physical AI?

Physical AI combines artificial intelligence with physical embodiment - creating intelligent systems that can perceive, reason, and act in the real world. From robotic manipulators to autonomous vehicles, Physical AI is transforming how machines interact with our physical environment.

## Learning Path

Our curriculum is designed to take you from fundamentals to cutting-edge applications through four comprehensive modules:

### 🤖 [Module 1: Robotic Nervous System](./01-robotic-nervous-system/intro.md)

Learn the foundational architecture of robotic systems. Understand how robots sense, process, and respond to their environment - the essential "nervous system" that makes robots function.

**Topics**: Sensor systems, data processing, control loops, communication protocols

### 🔷 [Module 2: Digital Twin](./02-digital-twin/intro.md)

Master the art of creating virtual replicas of physical robots. Digital Twins enable safe testing, simulation, and optimization before deploying to real hardware.

**Topics**: 3D modeling, simulation environments, physics engines, virtual-physical synchronization

### 🧠 [Module 3: AI Robot Brain](./03-ai-robot-brain/intro.md)

Dive into artificial intelligence for robotics. Learn how machine learning and neural networks give robots the ability to learn, adapt, and make intelligent decisions.

**Topics**: Neural networks, computer vision, reinforcement learning, decision-making algorithms

### 👁️ [Module 4: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) Models](./04-vla/intro.md)

Explore the frontier of Physical AI with multimodal models that combine vision, language understanding, and physical actions - the future of intelligent robotics.

**Topics**: Multimodal AI, vision-language models, embodied AI, action prediction

## How to Use This Platform
