## Physical AI Education Platform

Welcome to **Robotext** — your comprehensive, AI-native learning platform for Physical AI, humanoid robotics, and embodied intelligence. Designed to bridge the gap between theoretical AI and real-world application, this course takes you from foundational concepts to building advanced, autonomous humanoid robots.

This isn't just a textbook; it's a hands-on journey into the future of intelligent machines.

## 🚀 What You Will Learn

- **ROS 2 Fundamentals**: Master the Robotic Operating System (ROS 2), the industry standard for robot control.
- **Digital Twins & Simulation**: Build and test robots in high-fidelity simulators like Gazebo before deploying to hardware.
- **NVIDIA Isaac Platform**: Leverage GPU-accelerated perception and simulation for next-gen robotics.
- **Vision-Language-Action (VLA)**: Create robots that understand the world through vision and language to execute complex actions.
- **Humanoid Robotics**: Design and program bipedal robots capable of navigating human environments.

## 🤖 The Future of Work

The future of work is a partnership between humans, AI agents, and physical robots. **Physical AI** represents the next great frontier—giving AI a body, senses, and the ability to interact with the physical world.

> **Why Physical AI Matters**
> 
> Traditional AI lives in servers, processing data. **Physical AI** lives in the real world, perceiving environments through sensors, making real-time decisions, and taking actions through actuators. This embodied intelligence is revolutionizing industries from healthcare and manufacturing to logistics and home assistance.

## 📚 Comprehensive Learning Path

Our curriculum is organized into **4 progressive modules** spanning **13 weeks**, covering the entire stack of modern robotics:

### Module 1: The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2)
**Weeks 1-5** | _Foundation_

Learn the core framework that connects sensors, brains, and muscles. You will master ROS 2 architecture, nodes, topics, services, and advanced communication patterns.

- [**Week 1**: Introduction to Physical AI](./01-robotic-nervous-system/01-intro-physical-ai.mdx)
- **Week 2**: The Physical AI Landscape
- **Week 3**: ROS 2 Architecture & Graph
- **Week 4**: Topics, Services & Actions
- **Week 5**: Advanced ROS 2 Patterns

### Module 2: The Digital Twin (Gazebo)
**Weeks 6-7** | _Simulation_

Build virtual replicas (Digital Twins) of your robots to test algorithms safely and cost-effectively. Master URDF modeling, physics simulation, and sensor integration in Gazebo.

- [**Week 6**: Simulation Fundamentals](./02-digital-twin/01-gazebo-simulation.mdx)
- **Week 7**: Advanced URDF & World Modeling

### Module 3: The AI-Robot Brain (NVIDIA Isaac™)
**Weeks 8-10** | _Intelligence_

Leverage GPU-accelerated AI for real-time perception, navigation, and manipulation. Learn to use the NVIDIA Isaac platform for high-performance robot autonomy.

- [**Week 8**: Introduction to Isaac Platform](./03-ai-robot-brain/intro.md)
- **Week 9**: Isaac SDK & Perception Pipelines
- **Week 10**: Advanced Navigation & Manipulation

### Module 4: Vision-Language-Action (VLA)
**Weeks 11-13** | _Advanced Integration_

Create robots that can perceive, reason, and chat. This module focuses on multi-modal AI models that combine vision and language to drive physical actions, culminating in a capstone project.

- [**Week 11**: Humanoid Development](./04-vla/intro.md)
- **Week 12**: Multi-modal VLA Models
- **Week 13**: Capstone: Conversational Humanoid Robot

## 🎓 Learning Approach

This course follows a **progressive complexity** model:

1.  **Phase 1 (Weeks 1-2)**: Fundamental concepts and the "Why" of Physical AI.
2.  **Phase 2 (Weeks 3-10)**: Core technical skills (ROS 2, Gazebo, Isaac) and the "How".
3.  **Phase 3 (Weeks 11-13)**: Advanced integration, VLA models, and the "What's Next".

**Each week includes:**
- 📖 **Theory**: Clear, in-depth explanations of concepts.
- 💻 **Hands-on Code**: Python and C++ examples you can run.
- 🎨 **Visuals**: Architecture diagrams and flowcharts.
- ✅ **Assessments**: Quizzes and challenges to test your knowledge.

## 🛠️ Prerequisites
