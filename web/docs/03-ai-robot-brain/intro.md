# Module 3: AI Robot Brain

## Introduction

Welcome to **Module 3**, where things get smart. In this module, we move beyond basic control logic and enter the realm of **AI and Deep Learning**.

We will use the **NVIDIA Isaac Platform** to give our robots the ability to see, understand, and navigate their world using powerful GPUs.

## Module Curriculum

This module covers the "Brain" of the robot:

1.  **Isaac Sim**: The training ground where robots learn skills in a safe, photorealistic metaverse.
2.  **Isaac ROS**: The deployment stack that runs fast, hardware-accelerated AI on the physical robot.

### Topics Covered

- **[The AI-Robot Brain (NVIDIA Isaac Platform)](./01-nvidia-isaac.mdx)**
    - **Simulation**: Using Omniverse for photorealism.
    - **Synthetic Data**: Generating infinite labeled data for training.
    - **Perception**: Visual SLAM, Object Detection, and Depth Estimation.
    - **Optimization**: Using TensorRT and cuMotion for speed.

## Prerequisites

- **Module 1 & 2**: You should know ROS 2 and Gazebo concepts.
- **Hardware**: An NVIDIA GPU (RTX series) is highly recommended for this module.

## Getting Started

Let's turn that metal shell into a thinking machine.
