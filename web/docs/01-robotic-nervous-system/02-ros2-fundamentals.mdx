# ROS 2 Fundamentals

**ROS 2** (Robot Operating System) is not actually an operating system like Windows or Linux. It is a **middleware**—a set of software libraries and tools that help you build robot applications. Think of it as the "nervous system" that connects the brain (algorithms) to the body (motors and sensors).

## The ROS 2 Graph

A ROS 2 system is a network of communicating programs called **Nodes**.

![Schematic of the ROS 2 Graph showing Nodes as circles and Topics as pipes connecting them. Style: NotebookLM dark mode schematic.](/img/docs/01/ros2-graph.png)

- **Node**: A single process that performs a computation (e.g., "Read Camera", "Detect Face").
- **Topic**: A channel for streaming data (e.g., `/camera/image_raw`).
- **Message**: The data structure sent over a topic.

## Publisher / Subscriber Model

The primary way nodes communicate is through **Publish/Subscribe**.

1. **Publisher**: Sends data to a topic.
2. **Subscriber**: Listens to a topic.

### Python Example: Minimal Publisher

```python title="minimal_publisher.py"
import rclpy
from rclpy.node import Node
from std_msgs.msg import String

class MinimalPublisher(Node):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__('minimal_publisher')
        self.publisher_ = self.create_publisher(String, 'topic', 10)
        timer_period = 0.5  # seconds
        self.timer = self.create_timer(timer_period, self.timer_callback)
        self.i = 0

    def timer_callback(self):
        msg = String()
        msg.data = 'Hello World: %d' % self.i
        self.publisher_.publish(msg)
        self.get_logger().info('Publishing: "%s"' % msg.data)
        self.i += 1

def main(args=None):
    rclpy.init(args=args)
    node = MinimalPublisher()
    rclpy.spin(node)
    node.destroy_node()
    rclpy.shutdown()

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
```

## Launch Files

In a real robot, we don't start 50 nodes manually. We use **Launch Files**.

```xml title="robot_launch.xml"
<launch>
    <!-- Start the Camera Driver Node -->
    <node pkg="camera_pkg" exec="camera_driver" name="camera_node">
        <param name="resolution" value="1080p"/>
    </node>

    <!-- Start the Brain Node -->
    <node pkg="brain_pkg" exec="object_detector" name="detector_node"/>
</launch>
```

:::warning Real-Time Constraints
ROS 2 is designed for real-time systems. Ensure your network (DDS) is configured correctly for low latency.
