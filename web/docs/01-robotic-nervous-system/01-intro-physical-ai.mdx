# Introduction to Physical AI

**Physical AI** refers to AI systems that function in reality and comprehend physical laws. Unlike digital AI (like ChatGPT) which operates in a world of text and tokens, Physical AI must deal with gravity, friction, and the unpredictability of the real world.

## Physical AI vs. Digital AI

The transition from Digital AI to Physical AI involves moving from "The Cloud" to "The Edge".

| Feature | Digital AI | Physical AI |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Environment** | Static / Digital | Dynamic / Physical |
| **Input** | Text / Images | Sensor Data (LIDAR, IMU) |
| **Output** | Text / Pixels | Motor Torques / Action |
| **Cost of Failure** | Incorrect Text | Physical Damage |

## Sensor Systems

To interact with the world, a robot needs senses. We call these **Sensors**.

### Key Sensors
- **LIDAR**: Light Detection and Ranging. Measures distance.
- **IMU**: Inertial Measurement Unit. Measures acceleration and rotation (balance).
- **Camera**: RGB and Depth. Provides visual context.

## Reading Sensor Data (Python)

Here is a simple example of how we might read data from a simulated sensor in Python.

```python title="simple_sensor.py"
import random
import time

class LidarSensor:
    def __init__(self, range_max=10.0):
        self.range_max = range_max

    def read_distance(self):
        # Simulate sensor noise
        noise = random.uniform(-0.1, 0.1)
        actual_distance = 5.0 # meters
        return min(self.range_max, max(0.0, actual_distance + noise))

def main():
    lidar = LidarSensor()
    
    print("Starting Sensor Stream...")
    try:
        while True:
            dist = lidar.read_distance()
            print(f"Distance: {dist:.2f} meters")
            time.sleep(1.0)
    except KeyboardInterrupt:
        print("Stopping.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

:::info Key Takeaway
Physical AI requires **Embodied Intelligence**—the ability to plan and act while respecting the constraints of the physical body and environment.
