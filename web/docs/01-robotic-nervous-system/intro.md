# Module 1: Robotic Nervous System

## Introduction

Welcome to **Module 1**, where you will build the foundation of your journey into Physical AI. This module focuses on the **Robotic Nervous System (RNS)**—the architecture that connects a robot's brain (AI) to its body (Actuators) through its senses (Sensors).

We will primarily focus on **ROS 2** (Robot Operating System 2), the industry-standard middleware that powers everything from Roomba vacuum cleaners to NASA's Mars rovers.

## Module Curriculum

In this module, you will master the following relationships:

- **Robots are not just code**: They are physical systems with mass, inertia, and constraints.
- **Sensors are the eyes and ears**: How to process data from LIDAR, Cameras, and IMUs.
- **ROS 2 is the glue**: How Nodes, Topics, and Services enable distributed computing.

### Topics Covered

1.  **[Introduction to Physical AI](./01-intro-physical-ai.mdx)**
    - Embodied Intelligence
    - The Sense-Think-Act Loop
    - Physical vs. Digital AI

2.  **[ROS 2 Fundamentals](./02-ros2-fundamentals.mdx)**
    - The Node Graph Architecture
    - Publish / Subscribe Communication
    - Creating Packages and Nodes
    - Quality of Service (QoS) and Real-time constraints

## Prerequisites

- **Python**: Basic understanding of functions and classes.
- **Terminal**: Comfort with command-line interfaces.
- **OS**: Ubuntu Linux (recommended) or a robust VM/Container setup.
