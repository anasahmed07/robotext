# Module 2: The Digital Twin

## Introduction

Welcome to Module 2, where you'll discover the concept of Digital Twins and their crucial role in modern robotics and simulation.

## Module Curriculum

We will focus on the two pillars of robotic simulation:

1.  **Gazebo**: A high-fidelity physics simulator that calculates gravity, friction, collisions, and sensor data.
2.  **URDF (Unified Robot Description Format)**: The XML language used to describe what your robot looks like and how it moves.

### Topics Covered

- **[Robot Simulation with Gazebo & URDF](./01-gazebo-simulation.mdx)**
    - **Gazebo Architecture**: Physics engines (ODE, Bullet) and rendering.
    - **URDF Modeling**: Links, Joints, Inertial tensors, and Visuals.
    - **XACRO**: Making your robot models modular and reusable.
    - **Simulation**: Spawning robots and bridging topics to ROS 2.

## Prerequisites

- Completion of Module 1: Robotic Nervous System
- Basic understanding of 3D concepts
- Python programming skills

## Getting Started

Digital Twins bridge the gap between the physical and virtual worlds. Let's explore how!
