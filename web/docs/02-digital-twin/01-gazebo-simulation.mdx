# Robot Simulation with Gazebo

**Gazebo** is a powerful physics engine and 3D environment for robot simulation. It allows you to test your algorithms in a realistic virtual world before deploying them to expensive and fragile hardware. This is the essence of the **Digital Twin**.

## Gazebo Architecture

Gazebo operates on a client-server model.

- **gzserver**: Runs the physics loop and sensor generation. It can run "headless" (without a window).
- **gzclient**: The graphical interface that renders the scene.

## The URDF Format

To simulate a robot, we must describe it. We use **URDF** (Unified Robot Description Format). It is an XML file that defines the robot's physical properties.

### Key Components
- **Link**: A rigid body (e.g., forearm, wheel). Has mass and inertia.
- **Joint**: Connects two links (e.g., hinge, slider). Defines range of motion.

### URDF Example: A Simple Joint

Here is how you define a simple arm with two links connected by a hinge joint.

```xml title="simple_arm.urdf"
<robot name="simple_arm">
  <!-- Base Link -->
  <link name="base_link">
    <visual>
      <geometry>
        <cylinder length="0.6" radius="0.2"/>
      </geometry>
    </visual>
  </link>

  <!-- Moving Link -->
  <link name="forearm">
    <visual>
      <geometry>
        <box size="0.1 0.1 0.5"/>
      </geometry>
    </visual>
  </link>

  <!-- The Joint connecting them -->
  <joint name="elbow_joint" type="revolute">
    <parent link="base_link"/>
    <child link="forearm"/>
    <origin xyz="0 0 0.6"/>
    <axis xyz="0 1 0"/>
    <limit lower="-1.57" upper="1.57" effort="1000.0" velocity="0.5"/>
  </joint>
</robot>
```

:::tip Physics Matters
For a stable simulation, you MUST define `<inertial>` properties (mass, inertia matrix) for every link. If you don't, your robot might explode in the physics engine!
